<body>
    <p>This is a message to my future self I may not see this I may I don't know, I am currently trying to code and with a deep sense of hopelessness that I may not got what it takes to learn something like this but I just want to say to my future self to keep pushing and that you'll get there</p>
    <p>I don't really know anything specifically I need to say in this but just don't quit coding and go back to playing dumb video games that are only a waste of time and become thing that you can be proud.</p>
    <p>Anyways that is it for now keep coding!</p>
